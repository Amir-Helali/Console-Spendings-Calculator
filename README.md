# Console application in C++ to help you calculate your weekly spendings

Especially important for univeristy students short on finances (just like myself)

# Installation

The application is as simple as a console application gets.
You clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/NikolaBV/Console-Spendings-Calculator.git
```

then you head to the "code" folder where the main cpp file is (main.cpp)

you compile it

```
g++ -Iinclude src/main.cpp src/spendings_calculator.cpp -o build/spendings
```

and run it

```
./spendings
```

That's it!

# Purpose of the project

I began working on this project to use it as a learning tool in the beginning of my C++ journey. I recently
started studying "Software engineering" at Plovdiv University and wanted to made a small simple project
that will include all the basics of the language like variables, conditional statements, loops, functions of different types,
object oriented programming, data structures and algorithms, memory management, ect.

# Future of the project

It is under development because as i mentioned in the previous section I am using this project to get familiar
with C++ as a language so new features will be added (and maybe the whole structure of the project) continuously.
I am planning to turn it into a full stack application with a database but for now I'm trying to keep it as simple as possible.
